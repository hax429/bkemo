**Codian** is a multi-provider AI agent workspace for Obsidian. Instead of treating your vault as one-off context, it keeps notes, folders, conversations, Skills, and local tools working around the same problem. Use installed agents from sidebar chat or inline editing while preserving each provider's native authentication, session, and permission boundaries; your reasoning, execution, and results stay in your vault.

## ✨ Feature Highlights

- 💬 **Continuous Conversation Workflow**: Multi-tab interface, saved conversations, fast session search, resume, fork, rewind, and provider-native history replay. Conversation-dot navigation previews and jumps to each prompt.
- ✏️ **Inline Editing**: Inline prompt execution with real-time word-level diff previews directly in your active editor.
- 📝 **Live Markdown Composer**: Powered by CodeMirror 6 live preview, auto-completing `@note` and `@folder` mentions, drag-and-drop vault items, image attachments, and File Explorer "Add to Codian" integration.
- 🌐 **Provider-Native Connections**: Supports 6 local CLI providers (`claude`, `codex`, `kimi`, `grok`, `opencode`, `pi`). Models, sessions, authentication, and permissions follow provider-native capabilities; feature parity is never assumed.
- ⚙️ **Shared Workspace Resources**: Manage Skills, MCP servers, subagents, and commands. Supported providers can discover managed symlink Skills from vault `.agents/skills`.
- 🔧 **Models and Claude Services**: Model menus are organized by provider. Claude supports custom models, aliases, China Science and Technology Cloud, Alibaba Bailian, Volcengine Ark, DeepSeek, and custom Anthropic-compatible endpoints. Secrets use Obsidian `SecretStorage`.
- ✨ **Focused Entry Experience**: Empty chats show a reduced-motion-aware thinking-orbs animation; switch back to traditional navigation buttons when preferred.
- 🛡️ **Privacy & Safety**: Operates directly with local provider CLIs. No third-party telemetry services.

## 🚀 Installation

### Option 1: Obsidian Community Plugins (Recommended)
1. Open Obsidian **Settings** -> **Community plugins**.
2. Search for **Codian** (Plugin ID: `codianz`).
3. Click **Install**, then **Enable**.

### Option 2: Manual Installation (Release Build)
1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from the latest [GitHub Release](https://github.com/BCS1037/codian/releases).
2. Open your Vault's plugin directory: `<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/codianz/` (create the `codianz` folder if it does not exist).
3. Copy the 3 downloaded files into that folder.
4. Reload Obsidian or toggle **Codian** on in Community plugins settings.

### Option 3: Build from Source (Developers)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BCS1037/codian.git
cd codian
npm ci
npm run build
```
Copy the generated `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` to your vault's `.obsidian/plugins/codianz/` directory.

## ⚙️ Configuration & Third-Party Endpoints

Codian includes provider-neutral configuration controls under Obsidian Settings:

- **Third-Party Claude Profiles**: Configure custom Anthropic-compatible endpoints (e.g., Alibaba Bailian, Volcengine Ark, China Science & Technology Cloud) directly in the Claude Provider tab.
- **SecretStorage**: API keys and auth tokens are securely stored using Obsidian's native SecretStorage API rather than stored in plain text files.
- **Provider Connection Settings**: Configure absolute CLI executable paths or provider-specific parameters per provider under **Settings** -> **Provider** -> **Connection**.

---

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions & Troubleshooting

### 1. Why does Codian report "CLI not detected"?
macOS GUI applications (launched via Finder or Dock) do not automatically inherit environment variables defined in Shell configuration files (e.g., `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`).
- **Fix**: Go to Codian **Settings** -> **Provider** -> select the target Provider -> **Connection** tab, and enter the absolute file path to the CLI executable in **CLI Path** (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/claude` or `/opt/homebrew/bin/codex`).

### 2. How to set up Kimi Code CLI?
Kimi Code CLI requires an initial login before Codian can start an ACP session.
- **Fix**: Open your terminal, run `kimi`, and complete the interactive authentication process. Once configured, Codian will be able to discover models and connect successfully.

### 3. What is the difference between plugin ID `codianz` and display name `Codian`?
`codianz` is the unique internal plugin identifier registered with the Obsidian Community Plugin registry, while **Codian** is the user-visible display name. Always ensure your vault's plugin directory is named `codianz`.
